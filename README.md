# ARIMA_Time_Series_Forecasting_In_Python
## AIM: 
Implementing ARIMA Time Series Forecasting ML models to predict sales.
## Introduction: 
Forecasting sales is a common and essential use of machine learning (ML). Sales forecasts can be used to identify benchmarks and determine incremental impacts of new initiatives, plan resources in response to expected demand, and project future budgets. In this article, I will show how to implement ML models to predict sales.

The main objective of this project is to effectively implement the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series forecasting. The following steps are taken to achieve this goal:

Visualize the Time Series Data: Understand the data by visualizing it in a way that reveals patterns and trends.

Make the Data Stationary: Ensure the data is stationary, meaning it does not exhibit underlying trends or patterns that could impact forecasting accuracy.

Analyze Correlation and Autocorrelation: Identify relationships between past and current data points to determine appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model.

Build the ARIMA Model: Develop the ARIMA model based on data characteristics. If the data shows seasonal patterns, consider using Seasonal ARIMA.

Make Predictions: Utilize the ARIMA model to make accurate forecasts for future time points, leveraging the patterns identified in the data.

## Install some packages on which our dependency

        pip install matplotlib
        pip install seaborn
        pip install pandas
## To Run Code 
        Here, I'm using Jupyter Notebook to write code so you can run code to select cell from above to down.
